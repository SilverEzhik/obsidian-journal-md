# Journal.md

This plugin is for people who want their daily journal to be in a single file.

It will:

-   Automatically create headings for your Journal.md file
    -   The heading format can be customized in the settings
-   Provide an action and a sidebar shortcut to quickly open your Journal.md file
-   Provide an action to quickly append something to the latest entry in the Journal.md file

Additionally, there are two URI handlers for working with the journal:

-   `obsidian://journal/open` - opens your journal
-   `obsidian://journal/append?text=...` - appends text to the latest entry in your Journal.md file
